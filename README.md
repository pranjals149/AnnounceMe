<p>AnnounceMe is an announcement portal. It allows users to login with their google accounts. After successfully loging in, a user have two options - Join a room or Create a room. If a user wants to join the room created by another user then he/she has to enter the <strong>Room Code</strong> that is generated after creating a room. Now, if a user creates a room, the room is given a unique id (i.e Room Code). Room code is used to join other people on that room. In a particular room, users can make any announcements or can start a discussion.</p>
